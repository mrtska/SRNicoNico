PREAMBLE<LineBreak />
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<LineBreak />
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<LineBreak />
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<LineBreak />
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<LineBreak />
with others.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<LineBreak />
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<LineBreak />
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <LineBreak />
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<LineBreak />
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<LineBreak />
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<LineBreak />
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<LineBreak />
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<LineBreak /><LineBreak />
